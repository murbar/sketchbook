      <h1>String tweening</h1>
      <p>
        I converted the characters to char codes and tweened between the codes, converting back to a
        string along the way using React Spring's interpolation helper. We could set the{' '}
        <code>from</code> param on the spring object to a random string the same length as the input
        to tween on load and tween between values that are the same in the currently string and the
        next string.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Edit:</strong> For an unknown reason, the chars array being tweened shrinks to match
        new props but will not expand again. E.g. if we start with string length 10 and increase it
        to 15, only the first 10 chars will render. If we then set it to length 8, only 8 chars will
        ever render, etc. My solution pads the string's char code array with a sentinel value of
        empty string then filters those values out again before the chars are interpolated into the
        view. We pad to the length of the longest input string, so the chars array length will
        always less than or equal to that. And <code>config: true</code> resolves an issue where
        additional chars don't animate if the string is longer than the perviously rendered string.
