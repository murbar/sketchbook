        I converted the characters to char codes and tweened between the codes, converting
        back to a string along the way using React Spring's interpolation helper.
      </p>
      <p>
        The chars array shrinks when the props change but never expands. E.g. if we start
        with string length 10 and increase it to 15, only the first 10 chars will render.
        If we then set it to length 8, only 8 chars will ever render. I'm not sure what
        causes this but it's acceptable since the library wasn't meant to be used like
        this anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        My solution is to render a new whole new component when the child string changes.
        I did this with this poem by filtering the array of lines to return one line whose
        index matches the current line number and insuring the rendered element has a
        unique key. If the keys aren't unique, the element (and it's useSpring hook) will
        be reused and will only ever render as many characters as the smallest string it
        is given.
      </p>

      <p>Note this technique won't work so well with really long string. </p>
